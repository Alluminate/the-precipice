    title: 'How does a continuous integration workflow play into blockchain development?',
    content: "Continuous Integration (CI) is crucial to blockchain development by enhancing code quality, accelerating release cycles, and fostering a more efficient workflow. With CI, developers can merge changes back to the main branch as often as possible, allowing for early detection and swift resolution of potential integration bugs. State errors, type errors, and race conditions in blockchain engineering can pose serious obstacles. Regular integration helps ensure that the codebase remains consistent, reliable, and ready for deployment at any time, which is critical for maintaining trust with clients and security in their deployed products. Furthermore, CI encourages a culture of shared responsibility for the code, improving the team’s ability to communicate and deliver."

    title: 'What’s the average cost of developing a protocol?',
    content: "The cost of developing a solution or protocol varies greatly. It depends on a variety of factors such as the complexity of the project, whether it’s MVP development, a feature request, Web 3.0 integration into an existing stack, or protocol engineering. It depends on Thorium’s resources needed to execute the objectives and the timeline for completion. Proposals range from tens of thousands to millions of dollars. At Thorium, we don't believe in a one-size-fits-all pricing model. Instead, we provide bespoke pricing and product solutions tailored to our client's specific needs and budget. During our consultation process, we work closely with clients to understand their objectives, assess the scope of the project, and provide a detailed cost estimate. We deliver proposals on the day. We believe in transparency and will always communicate any cost implications upfront, ensuring that there are no surprises along the way."
