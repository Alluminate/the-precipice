# `[slug]` Folder: Technical Documentation

## 📝 Introduction

- **Purpose**: To serve as the Next.js route that will dynamically render blog posts based on tags.
- **Technical Context**: It primarily employs server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) paradigms.

## 🎯 Objective

- **Primary Goal**: To correctly route to pages based on tags and display the associated blogs in preview cards.
- **Performance Metrics**: Optimization for sub-200ms Time to First Byte (TTFB) and a Lighthouse SEO score above 90.

## 📂 Directory Structure

- `/[slug]/page.tsx`: Original implementation
- `/[slug]/newer.tsx`: Experimental version
- `/[slug]/clientsidecomponent.tsx`: Client-side component for async fetches

## 🧰 Main Components

### `page.tsx`

- **Role**: Root-level file, responsible for orchestrating SSR/SSG.
- **Functionality**: Utilizes Next.js’s `GetStaticPaths` and `GetStaticProps` for SSG and fetches blogs via Contentful API.

### `newer.tsx`

- **Role**: Intended to supersede `page.tsx`, but with client-side navigation optimization.
- **API Interaction**: Consumes Contentful's SDK through a singleton instance (`contentfulApiInstance`).

### `clientsidecomponent.tsx`

- **Role**: Client-side logic module for `page.tsx`.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Makes use of `useEffect` to asynchronously load blog posts if they are not available at build time.

## 📦 Dependencies & Libraries

- **Next.js**: Core framework, version: latest.
- **Contentful SDK**: Content Management System (CMS) for blog content.

## 🌐 API Endpoints & Functions

- `fetchBlogPostsByTag()`: Direct API call for retrieving blog posts based on tags.
- `getPaths()`: Fetches all possible paths for SSG, integral to the `getStaticPaths` lifecycle method.

## 💡 Dynamic Metadata Generation

- `generateMetadata()`: Dynamic SEO metadata injection via SSR.
- **SMO Practices**: Automatic OpenGraph and Twitter card generation for improved social media visibility.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **API Rate Limiting**: Keep an eye on the Contentful rate limits. Implement backoff algorithms if necessary.
- **Data Validation**: Use strong types to validate the incoming data shape from the Contentful API.

## 🚀 Deployment & Scaling

- **CDN Configuration**: Leverage Next.js' built-in CDN capabilities for optimal content delivery.
- **Serverless**: Code is designed to be compatible with serverless architectures.

## 🚧 Known Issues & Troubleshooting

- **Fallback Behavior**: Check the `fallback` attribute in `getStaticPaths` to see if it's set to `true` or `blocking`.
- **Network Errors**: Make sure to encapsulate the API requests in try-catch blocks to handle network issues gracefully.

## 📈 Metrics & Monitoring

- **Performance KPIs**: Use tools like Google Lighthouse and Web Vitals for comprehensive metrics.
- **Error Logging**: Integrate with platforms like Sentry for real-time error tracking.
