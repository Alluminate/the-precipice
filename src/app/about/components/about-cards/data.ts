    description: "For all of history, meaning in one’s life has been derived from Labor or Caste.\nTo this day, underprivileged communities in the US and abroad internalize that money in one’s pocket for a hard day’s work equates to personal value.\nThe cracks are showing. since the 1980s, humanity’s relationship with technology has changed. Automation scaled output more than labor. Processes adapted to maximize economies of scale, to the detriment of human meaning.\nEnter the Web 3.0 narrative, which offers the instruments that can challenge the Labor = Value relationship.\nInstead... Meaning can derive from Participation.\nWeb3 is evangelizing Financial Literacy for young adults across the world. History held that creating, participating, and investing were intangible; but today these are tangible Value Streams.\nThe evolution of human value is based in seamless integration of finance and asset management. This will be powered by the Web 3.0 tech stack."
