# Focuses Classes

- `focus-visible:ring-2`: When the element is focused via keyboard navigation, it gets a ring (akin to a border) with a width of 2 units.
- `focus-visible:ring-ring`: This applies a specific color to the focus ring. The color named "ring" should be defined elsewhere in your styles or configuration.
- `focus-visible:ring-offset-2`: When the element is focused using keyboard navigation, this adds a 2-unit wide offset to the ring.
- `focus-visible:outline-none`: This removes the default browser outline only when an element is focused using keyboard navigation. The focus-visible class in TailwindCSS uses the :focus-visible pseudo-selector.
- `ring-offset-background`: This applies an offset color behind a CSS ring. The specific color (background) should be defined somewhere else in your styles or configuration.

# Gradient Classes

- `bg-gradient-to-r`: This sets the background of the element to have a gradient that flows from left (start) to right (end).
- `from-primary-from`: This defines the starting color of the gradient. The actual color represented by "primary-from" would be defined in your Tailwind configuration.
- `to-primary`: This defines the ending color of the gradient, which is presumably a primary color defined in your configuration.
- `transition-colors`: This enables smooth transitions on color-related properties (like background-color, text-color) when they change, usually on hover or other states.

# Pointer Classes

- `disabled:pointer-events-none`: This ensures that when the button is disabled, it will not receive any pointer events, making it unclickable and uninteractable.
